# TV Sleuth

## What is it?

tvSleuth is a Chrome extension to keep track of your favourite TV programs.

You can search for programs, manage a list of favourite ones, and the extension will prompt you when new episodes have aired.

## Build

The extension comes pre-built, but you can easily build it yourself. It uses 'gulp' for building, and 'npm' for maintaining packages.

## Install

- download and unpack the zip file (`Download ZIP` on right side)
- go to `chrome://extensions`
- check `Developer mode` (top right)
- click `Load unpacked extension...` (top left)
- point it to the extension (the folder with the manifest.json file)
- click `Select`

## Requirements

You'll need an API key from https://www.themoviedb.org.
